My name is Rohan and I study in class 10th at St. Xavier's High School. I live in Mumbai with my parents and my younger sister. One interesting fact about me is that I can solve a Rubik's cube in under one minute. My favorite hobby is playing football and reading comic books. In the future, I want to become a software engineer. Thank you for listening.
